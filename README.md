Calendar reminders to keep you focused. Polls your calendar every 15 minutes to find what the current task is and displays it consistently at the bottom of your screen.

To make any changes, just change the variables in `config.py`.

To use:
1. Clone repository.
2. Download `uv` using `pip install uv` or more preferably `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.
3. Run `uv sync` in the project directory to install dependencies.
4. Create a shortcut for `remind-init.ps1` in your startup folder to have it run on login.

The program should automatically authenticate with Google Calendar by opening a browser window the first time it is run. If something doesn't work, you can contact me directly.
