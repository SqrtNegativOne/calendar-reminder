Calendar reminders to keep you focused. Polls your calendar every 15 minutes to find what the current task is and displays it consistently at the bottom of your screen.

Uses uv for efficient and reproducible package management. TKinter for an extremely minimal and performant GUI (and also because I haven't figured out Win32 API (yet)).
